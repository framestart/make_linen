**make_linen.py** is a small script to create trendy linen background images by randomly superimposing "fibers" onto a plain background.

The resulting images are tileable, however, you might still see some repetition of the random pattern if your tiles are too small.

Play with the parameters to get the result you require. Once the image is generated open test.html to see the tiled background in action.

Requires:
- numpy http://numpy.scipy.org/
- matplotlib http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
