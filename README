make_linen.py is a small python script to create linen-like background images by randomly superimposing "fibers" onto a plain background.

The resulting images are tileable, however, you might still see some repetition of random pattern if your tiles are too small.

Play with the parameters to get the result you require.

Requires:
	numpy http://numpy.scipy.org/
	matplotlib http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
